One of the most popular designs in American coinage, the Silver Eagle combines beauty with Silver bullion appeal. Add the 2019 1 oz Silver Eagle to your cart today!  The 2019 Silver Eagle has History on its Side First released November 24, 1986, the 1 oz Silver American Eagle quickly became the most popular Silver bullion coin not only in the United States, but in the entire world. The initial run sold out immediately “due to the phenomenal demand.” The Silver Eagle enjoys a special prestige as the only Silver bullion coin backed by the U.S. government. In fact, this Silver coin is so highly sought after that in 2014 and 2015 the U.S. Mint could not match its level of production to consumer demand. In 2013, after a historic drop in Silver prices, demand increased so much that the U.S. Mint had to ration the sale of Silver coins for 18 months. The driving force behind the creation of the Silver American Eagle was the government’s desire to sell off some of the Silver from the Defense National Stockpile. Although states with heavy mining interests and some legislators opposed the sale of the Silver, in 1985 the Senate agreed to permit Silver sales. In 2002, after it became apparent the stockpile of Silver would be depleted, an additional bill was passed that would allow the government to purchase Silver on the open market once it became necessary. The design of this particular Silver bullion coin is steeped in American heritage and tradition. On the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of Adolph A. Weinman’s “Walking Liberty” design, which was originally used on the Walking Liberty Half Dollar from 1916 to 1947. This iconic artwork was beloved by American citizens and thus was a natural choice years later as the mint selected historic designs to appear on the 1 oz Silver American Eagle. The reverse features a heraldic eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and arrows in the other with a shield on its chest. In its beak, the bird carries a banner reading, “E Pluribus Unum.” Above the eagle are 13 stars, a representation of the original 13 colonies. This image harkens to the Great Seal of the United States. These Silver bullion coins do not bear mintmarks, differentiating them from the Proof and Burnished versions, which do include a mintmark. From 1986 to 1998, they were manufactured at the San Francisco Mint. From 1999 to 2000, production was moved to the Philadelphia Mint. Since 2001, the 1 oz Silver American Eagle has been produced at the West Point Mint in New York, which is colloquially called the “Fort Knox of Silver.” Starting in 2011, due to the coin’s immense popularity, the San Francisco Mint began minting Silver American Eagles to supplement the output from the West Point Mint.    2019 American Silver Eagle Coins Considered by many to be the most popular bullion program in the history of the United States, the 2019 Silver American Eagle is a highly collectible coin. The iconic design and guaranteed quality are known to collectors and investors the world over. Known as the official Silver bullion coin of the U.S., the American Eagle contains one troy ounce of .999 fine Silver. The purity, weight, and Precious Metals composition are all certified by the U.S. Mint. While certainly profitable for the U.S. Mint, Silver American Eagles are acclaimed for more than mere sales.   U.S. Mint Silver Eagles The initial striking of U.S. Mint Silver Eagles took place in San Francisco. A ceremony was held, officiated by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III. The historically inspired design was originally created by Adolph A. Weinman for the 1916 Walking Liberty Half Dollar.

The 2018 Silver Eagle has History on its Side First released November 24, 1986, the 1 oz Silver American Eagle quickly became the most popular Silver bullion coin not only in the United States, but in the entire world. The initial run sold out immediately “due to the phenomenal demand.” The Silver Eagle enjoys a special prestige as the only Silver bullion coin backed by the U.S. government. In fact, this Silver coin is so highly sought after that in 2014 and 2015 the U.S. Mint could not match its level of production to consumer demand. In 2013, after a historic drop in Silver prices, demand increased so much that the U.S. Mint had to ration the sale of Silver coins for 18 months. The driving force behind the creation of the Silver American Eagle was the government’s desire to sell off some of the Silver from the Defense National Stockpile. Although states with heavy mining interests and some legislators opposed the sale of the Silver, in 1985 the Senate agreed to permit Silver sales. In 2002, after it became apparent the stockpile of Silver would be depleted, an additional bill was passed that would allow the government to purchase Silver on the open market once it became necessary. The design of this particular Silver bullion coin is steeped in American heritage and tradition. On the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of Adolph A. Weinman’s “Walking Liberty” design, which was originally used on the Walking Liberty Half Dollar from 1916 to 1947. This iconic artwork was beloved by American citizens and thus was a natural choice years later as the mint selected historic designs to appear on the 1 oz Silver American Eagle. The reverse features a heraldic eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and arrows in the other with a shield on its chest. In its beak, the bird carries a banner reading, “E Pluribus Unum.” Above the eagle are 13 stars, a representation of the original 13 colonies. This image harkens to the Great Seal of the United States. These Silver bullion coins do not bear mintmarks, differentiating them from the Proof and Burnished versions, which do include a mintmark. From 1986 to 1998, they were manufactured at the San Francisco Mint. From 1999 to 2000, production was moved to the Philadelphia Mint. Since 2001, the 1 oz Silver American Eagle has been produced at the West Point Mint in New York, which is colloquially called the “Fort Knox of Silver.” Starting in 2011, due to the coin’s immense popularity, the San Francisco Mint began minting Silver American Eagles to supplement the output from the West Point Mint.   Related Searches  American Silver Eagle Coins Silver Spot Price     The Silver American Eagle Features an Iconic American Design The 1 oz Silver American Eagle coin’s reverse depicts an American eagle behind a shield, bearing arrows in its left talon and an olive branch in its right. This design echoes the Great Seal of the United States designed by John Mercanti, the 12th chief engraver of the U.S. Mint, who retired in 2010. Mercanti was the most prolific engraver in U.S. Mint history, designing more medal and coin artwork than any other mint engraver. Precious Metals investors may well remember the 1984 Olympic Gold $10 coin, the 1986 Statue of Liberty Dollar coin or the 1989 Congress Bicentennial Gold $5 coin that all sport his work.   When Purchasing 2018 Silver Eagles, Understand Premium Over Spot Many investors especially like Silver American Eagles because the premium-over-spot price is generally fairly low. When you plan to buy Precious Metal items, watch the spot price of Silver, which is the cost of raw, unfabricated Silver, for the best time to purchase. When you buy Silver coins, you pay spot price of Silver plus a premium, which includes the cost of fabrication, distribution, a small dealer fee and any numismatic value. Many investors prize U.S. Silver coins and other items offering a low premium-over-spot price to be the best for growing their portfolios.

The type of Silver bullion you buy should always be driven by your individual investment goals.  Whether you purchase Silver bars or Silver coins depends on your investment goals. Many investors buy Silver bars in as large a quantity as possible at that time. For some, Silver bar purchases will be 5 oz Silver bars and for others, 50 oz bars. Some will forego Silver bullion and focus on Silver coins because they are also taking into consideration numismatic collector value. They prefer Silver coins to a 5 oz Silver bar, because although they are paying a slightly higher premium over the Silver spot price, they have a coin that allows them to hold a little piece of history in their hands.    Buy Silver and hold Precious Metals at a lower price point than Platinum, Gold or Palladium.  Silver bullion is priced lower than Gold bullion due to perception, demand and rarity (although some people would debate whether Gold is rarer than Silver). The current price of a Silver bar is about 70 times less than Gold bar prices, with some experts positing that the ratio should be 17 to 1. The lower price of Silver bars versus Gold bars can also be attributed to the fact that Gold is more difficult to mine and requires a purification process.

Morgan designed as assistant engraver at the Philadelphia U.S. Mint, he had already established himself as an artist and engraver in England where he received instruction at the Birmingham Art School and South Kensington Art School and worked for The British Royal Mint. When U.S. Mint director H.R. Linderman first met Morgan, he told him he wanted Lady Liberty’s portrait to make a return to American coinage. This meeting led to Morgan’s Silver Dollar design.

The first 3 years of mintage were in proof quality condition, and had a limited mintage of 10,000 pieces for each year. No Silver Pandas were struck in 1986, but they have been minted every year since then. Each year, the design of the panda changes making them highly collectible. The only year they didn’t change design was 2002, which used the same design as 2001. The People’s Republic of China issues and guarantees the quality of each Silver Panda coin. Silver Panda coins are minted from several mints each year. Those mints include but are not limited to Shenzhen, Shanghai and Shenyang. Unlike the U.S. Mint, these Chinese Mints do not incorporate mintmarks to distinguish the difference between each mint. Instead, these mints are known for having minor differences in the design of the coin such as font size, bamboo length and designs of the temple in certain year’s mintages. With the annual change in design, and unique mint variations, the price of Silver Pandas has appreciated over time making them highly sought after by collectors and investors.    Panda Chinese Silver Coins for Investment Investors and collectors alike love the regal design of the Chinese Silver Panda coins, making them one of the most popular bullion coins in the world. Like the official coins of many other countries, this series features one of China’s most iconic native species: the giant panda. These coins have not always been a leader in the marketplace, but time has proven they are a worthwhile investment for many reasons. The first minting of Silver Pandas was in 1983. Each year, the obverse is struck with a new design, but the artwork always features a Chinese panda. Most often, the panda bear is shown in a natural setting surrounded by a bamboo forest.   30 gram China Silver Panda Coins Design Because each year brings a unique design, Panda coins are exceptionally popular with collectors. On the reverse, the Taoist Temple of Heaven of Beijing is always depicted. The Temple is known as a sanctuary for Chinese royalty, a symbol of the country’s elite classes. The real temple was finished during the Ming Dynasty, with final touches added in 1420. The depiction on the coin has mostly been the same over the years, although some tweaks to the outline were made in 1987. It is interesting to note that the obverse Panda design did not change from 2001 to 2002, but that is the only exception. The China Gold Coin Corporation released this duplicated artwork, but collectors did not like this change to the series pattern. Because of public scrutiny, and an overwhelming preference for a new design each year, changing designs were reintroduced in 2003.   Compared to other bullion coins, 2019 Chinese Silver Pandas have a low mintage, creating limited supply for a much-desired investment.

Morgan designed for the launch of these beautiful Silver coins in 1878. Before designing Silver coins for the U.S. Mint, Morgan was a well-respected assistant engraver at the British Royal Mint, and it was this respect that earned him the recommendation from the British Royal Mint’s Director, Charles W. Fremantle, for the U.S. Mint job. Though the Silver bullion Morgan is best known for designing is the Morgan Silver Dollar, he also designed many other popular coins such as the Bland Dollar.    Scandal and intrigue surrounds 1921 Morgan Dollars. Before designing 1921 Morgan Dollars , engraver George T. Morgan needed to find a female model to help him create the Lady Liberty portrait he envisioned. Modeling for a Silver coin design, or any art for that matter, was considered scandalous and not something a proper woman would do. Eventually schoolteacher Anna Willess Williams agreed to model for the Silver bullion design under the strict provision that her identity remain anonymous because she could lose her job. Williams’ involvement with the Silver coins remained hidden for a while, though she did eventually lose her job when a newspaper reporter uncovered her secret years later.    The 1921 Morgan Dollar was released due to renewed desire for the Morgan Dollar design that had been discontinued in 1904.

Because these Silver Dollars were once circulated, imagining where the Silver coins could have been used and by whom is just part of the fun of owning them. Many who collect the Silver coins for their Wild West appeal, seek out Silver bullion minted by the U.S. Mint in Carson City, Nevada.

The design of Peace Dollars created quite a stir among World War I veterans who had obtained a copy of the winning design prior to the Peace Dollar being minted. While the veterans were satisfied with Lady Liberty depicted on the Silver coin’s obverse, it was the eagle on the reverse that caused them, and many other outraged U.S. citizens, to telegram President Harding asking for the artwork to be removed. What was so offensive about the initial Peace Dollar design? The reverse of the Peace Dollar showed an eagle holding an olive branch while perched on a broken sword, and many viewed the broken sword as a symbol of defeat, and certainly not of peace. Current U.S. Mint Chief Engraver George T. Morgan was swift to modify the design with the input of its initial designer, Anthony de Francisci, and it is this modified design that graces Peace Dollars.    Collect Peace Dollars designed by Italian immigrant and sculptor Anthony de Francisci.  Anthony de Francisci, most known for designing the Peace Dollar , realized the classic American dream by coming to the land of opportunity as an 8 year old with his Italian parents in 1895, and achieving success as a sculptor and coin designer through hard work and determination. Before creating his winning Silver Dollar design, de Francisci attended Cooper Union in Manhattan, and studied under renowned coin designer, James Earle Fraser. He also assisted Silver coin designers, Hermon MacNeil and Adolph A. Weinman, and it is most likely that his eventual hiring at the U.S. Mint was in part due to his contacts with his mentors. Besides the Peace Dollar, de Francisci also designed the Maine Centennial Commemorative Half Dollar .    Anthony de Francisci designed the Peace Dollar in 1921 to celebrate peace following World War I.
